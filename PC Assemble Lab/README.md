# PC Assemble Lab ðŸ› 

ðŸ“† On 6th November 2024, we had the opportunity to hands-on assemble and disassemble the components of the CPU of a PC during this PC Assemble Lab activity.

##### There are some photos below showing our progress: 

## Procedure for disassembling CPU:
1. Firstly, open the casing of the CPU.

2. Unplug all the cables that are connected to different components.  
3. Remove the power supply unit.

## To assemble the PC back, we do it reversely by:

1. First, install the CPU Fan.
2. Install the Hard Disk.
3. Install the RAM.
4. Install the power supply unit.
5. Connect the cables to the relevant components.

## ALL DONE! ðŸŽ‰

| Component               | Function                                                                                     |
|-------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **CPU (Central Processing Unit)** | The brain of the computer; handles all basic operations.                                   |
| **CPU Fan**             | Keeps the CPU cool to prevent overheating.                                                   |
| **RAM (Random Access Memory)** | Provides temporary memory for active tasks and processes.                                  |
| **Hard Disk (HDD)**     | Stores data permanently, even when the computer is off.                                       |
| **Power Supply Unit (PSU)** | Converts electrical power for the computer components.                                       |
| **Cables**              | Connects components to allow communication and proper functioning.                          |

## ðŸ’¡ Reflection:
Honestly, I was really surprised when I learned that we would have the opportunity to assemble and disassemble the CPU of a PC! Iâ€™ve always been someone who enjoys hands-on, practical exercises, and this lab provided me with invaluable experience. It gave me a deeper understanding of the components and structure of a CPU. This hands-on activity was incredibly helpful, and I feel more confident in my knowledge of how the parts of a computer work together. It truly was an unforgettable experience!
