## Key Highlight: PETRONAS Digital Young Graduate Programme (YGP)

One of the most inspiring parts of the session was learning about the **PETRONAS Digital Young Graduate Programme (YGP)**. This program offers a unique opportunity for graduates to explore potential career paths after graduation. 🎓💼

## IT Roles Highlighted

During the talk, three IT-related roles were highlighted:

- **Data Scientist**

The head of the department gave a clear and detailed explanation of each role, and this helped me understand the distinct differences between them. 💻 Before this talk, I was a bit confused because I thought these fields were quite similar, but now I have a better understanding of their unique focuses and how they align with my interests.
