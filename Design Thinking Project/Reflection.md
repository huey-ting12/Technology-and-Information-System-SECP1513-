# ðŸ’¡ Reflection on Design Thinking Project

This **Design Thinking** project has been an incredible journey, and Iâ€™m really proud of what weâ€™ve accomplished together. Weâ€™ve put in countless hours, and I truly believe the effort was well worth it! When we first started, I honestly didnâ€™t fully understand what **Design Thinking** was. Our theme for the project was **AI in IoT**, which is a hot topic these days, but also quite challenging. We had to brainstorm and identify a field or product that hadnâ€™t been explored yet.

### ðŸš€ **Working Through the Five Stages**
Working through the five stages of **Design Thinking**â€”**Empathize**, **Define**, **Ideate**, **Prototype**, and **Test**â€”helped me realize that innovation starts with truly understanding the user. First, we needed to **empathize with the user**, then **define the problem**, and only after that could we begin brainstorming solutions. After a lot of collaboration and many brainstorming sessions, our team decided to develop a **Smart Vending Machine** with **AI voice chat**, a **locker system** to prevent items from getting stuck, and **IoT integration** for both the vending machine operator and the users.

### ðŸŽ¨ **Exploring Figma for UI Design**  
One of the highlights of this project was the opportunity to dive into **Figma** and design the **UI** for our application, a responsibility I was given. As someone who is still new to **UI design**, it was an amazing experience to learn and experiment with this tool. Iâ€™m definitely still a beginner, but I feel like Iâ€™ve gained valuable skills and insights.

### ðŸŽ‰ **In Summary**  
Iâ€™m really happy with how everything turned out. Iâ€™m so grateful to my team members for their hard work and contributionsâ€”this project wouldnâ€™t have been possible without all of us working together. It was a fun and rewarding experience, and Iâ€™m excited to carry these lessons forward! ðŸŒŸ
