# PC Assemble Lab ðŸ› 

ðŸ“† On 6th November 2024, we had the opportunity to hands-on assemble and disassemble the components of the CPU of a PC during this PC Assemble Lab activity.

##### There are some photos below showing our progress: 

## Procedure for disassembling CPU:
1. Firstly, open the casing of the CPU.

2. Unplug all the cables that are connected to different components.  
3. Remove the power supply unit.

## To assemble the PC back, we do it reversely by:

1. First, install the CPU Fan.
2. Install the Hard Disk.
3. Install the RAM.
4. Install the power supply unit.
5. Connect the cables to the relevant components.
6. Test it with a monitor!
   
   And....  
   Successfully switch on the monitor! HoorayðŸŽ‰

| **CPU (Central Processing Unit)** | The brain of the computer; handles all basic operations.                                   |
| **CPU Fan**             | Keeps the CPU cool to prevent overheating.                                                   |
| **RAM (Random Access Memory)** | Provides temporary memory for active tasks and processes.                                  |
| **Hard Disk (HDD)**     | Stores data permanently, even when the computer is off.                                       |
| **Power Supply Unit (PSU)** | Converts electrical power for the computer components.                                       |
| **Cables**              | Connects components to allow communication and proper functioning.                          |

## Reflection:
Honestly, I was really surprised when I learned that we would have the opportunity to assemble and disassemble the CPU of a PC! Iâ€™ve always been someone who enjoys hands-on, practical exercises, and this lab provided me with invaluable experience. It gave me a deeper understanding of the components and structure of a CPU. This hands-on activity was incredibly helpful, and I feel more confident in my knowledge of how the parts of a computer work together. It truly was an unforgettable experience!
