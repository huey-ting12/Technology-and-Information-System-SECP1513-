# 💡 Reflection on Design Thinking Project

This **Design Thinking** project has been an incredible journey, and I’m really proud of what we’ve accomplished together. We’ve put in countless hours, and I truly believe the effort was well worth it! When we first started, I honestly didn’t fully understand what **Design Thinking** was. Our theme for the project was **AI in IoT**, which is a hot topic these days, but also quite challenging. We had to brainstorm and identify a field or product that hadn’t been explored yet.

### 🚀 **Working Through the Five Stages**
Working through the five stages of **Design Thinking**—**Empathize**, **Define**, **Ideate**, **Prototype**, and **Test**—helped me realize that innovation starts with truly understanding the user. First, we needed to **empathize with the user**, then **define the problem**, and only after that could we begin **brainstorming solutions**. After a lot of collaboration and many brainstorming sessions, our team decided to develop a **Smart Vending Machine** with **AI voice chat**, a **locker system** to prevent items from getting stuck, and **IoT integration** for both the vending machine operator and the users.

### 🎨 **Exploring Figma for UI Design** 

One of the highlights of this project **was the opportunity for me to dive into Figma** and design the **UI** for our application. As someone who is still new to **UI design**, it was an amazing experience to learn and experiment with this tool. I’m definitely still a beginner, but I feel like I’ve gained valuable skills and insights that will guide me in future design projects! 💡

### 🎉 **In Summary**  
I’m really happy with how everything turned out. I’m so grateful to my team members for their hard work and contributions—this project wouldn’t have been possible without all of us working together. It was a fun and rewarding experience, and I’m excited to carry these lessons forward! 🌟
