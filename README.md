# Technology-and-Information-System-SECP1513-

The Technology and Information Systems (SECP1513) subject has been a very valuable learning experience for me. It not only covered the theoretical aspects of networks and computers 🌐 but also helped me understand the fundamentals of software, hardware, databases, and network structures. What I found most helpful were the practical elements of the course, such as the PC assembly lab, where I gained hands-on experience. 🛠

Another highlight was the chance to visit different industries and attend talks by experts in the field. These experiences gave me a better understanding of how the concepts we studied in class are used in real-world situations. I’m grateful for the opportunities this course provided, and I feel that I’ve gained important skills and knowledge that will be useful as I move forward in the field of technology. 🚀
