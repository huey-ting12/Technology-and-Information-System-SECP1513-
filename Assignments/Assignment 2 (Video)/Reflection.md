On **10th December 2024**, we had the chance of visiting **UTM Digital**, and it couldn’t have been a better day for an industrial visit—the weather was **sunny**, and I was **excited beyond words**! 😄 This was my **first time** visiting a real workplace, and the experience was truly **eye-opening**.

## 🏢 Introduction to UTM Digital

The session began with an introduction to **UTM Digital's infrastructure**, where we learned about:
- Their **organizational chart**
- **Vision** and **mission**
- The various services they provide, including:
  - **Wi-Fi**
  - **Wired networks**
  - **Data engineering**

It was fascinating to realize that the **UTMID system** we use to access Wi-Fi and various portals, along with the networks around our campus, are all supported by a **large team** of backend professionals working diligently behind the scenes.

## 🖥️ Touring the Office

When we toured their **open office**, I was really surprised to see the team working hard to ensure everything runs smoothly for us. It was also my **first time** stepping into a real office environment, and this made me think about my own future work life. 💼

I hadn't expected the **UTM Digital Care department** to be as large as it is—it's a **huge department** located on a separate floor from the development teams. That was another realization for me: the **scale of operations** and the importance of each team in maintaining seamless service. 💡

## 🎥 Exploring the Tech

We also visited the **multipurpose room**, where we had the chance to experience the **Sangfor room** and see a **Newline Smartboard** in action. 🖥️✨

The demonstration of the technology, including features like:
- **Newline cast** (casting devices to the smartboard)
- **Newline broadcast** (casting from the smartboard to devices)

...really impressed me. It was amazing to see how **technology** is evolving and how it can make collaboration so much more efficient. 🚀

## 📝 System Analyst Interview

One of the highlights of the visit was an **interview with a System Analyst** at UTM Digital, where she shared insights into their workflow. She explained the following process they follow to develop new systems:

1. **Designing a prototype** to get approval.
2. Once the prototype is approved, they proceed with **designing the User Interface (UI)**.
3. After that, they move into the **development phase**.
4. The process continues with ongoing adjustments to fulfill all requirements, using **Agile methodology** to ensure constant collaboration.

## 💡 Key Takeaways

I left the visit feeling **incredibly inspired** and motivated about my future career. It was a great opportunity to see the inner workings of a company like UTM Digital, and I am **grateful** for the chance to learn from their **experienced, friendly staff**. 🌟

I look forward to what lies ahead in my career and am excited to apply the lessons I’ve learned during this visit. 🚀
